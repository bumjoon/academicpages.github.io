(2015 Fall) Bicycle Master Plan has been prepared to guide the town’s future plans and policies. 

# Background
* Client: The Town of Tonawanda
* 2015 Fall
The Town of Tonawanda Bicycle Master Plan has been prepared to guide the town’s future plans and policies. The plan provides new transportation and recreational alternatives for residents of the town while strengthening existing bicycle facilities. The Town of Tonawanda began a Complete Streets Committee in 2015 to begin to address issues of pedestrians and bicyclists within the town. This plan was created to offer guidance on policies, prioritization, and project proposals to the committee. The plan also functions as a Town of Tonawanda specific counterpart to the Greater Buffalo-Niagara Regional Transportation Council’s 2008 Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan for Erie and Niagara Counties.
